# Dataset preparation
I used [Caltech 10,000 Web Faces](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech_10K_WebFaces/) to train this model.

To save training time, all images and ground truths are zipped in one blob file in this directory.

1. Download dataset from this [link](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech_10K_WebFaces/) and decompress it here.
2. Run [prepare.py](../prepare.py)
